# International-Sales-Peformance-Analysis


## Project Overview
For this project, I worked on an **international sales dataset** that had information about Products and their Categories, Customers, and Stores  
The main goal was to use the data to see how sales were performing in different areas and to find insights that can help improve the business.

---

## How I Set It Up
- I created **6 relational tables** in MySQL:
  1. Category
  2. Customer
  3. Products
  4. Stores
  5. Sub Category
  6. Sales
- I imported the data straight into the tables and made sure there was relationships between the tables so the analysis would be easier.

---

## Connecting to Power BI
- I connected my MySQL database to Power BI.
- From there, I built two dashboards that showed:
  - Sales performance by product, category, and sub-category.
  - Who the top customers are and how much they buy.
  - Which stores are selling the most.
  - How sales are changing over time.

---

## Some Insights from the Analysis
- Found the best-selling products and categories.
- Saw which stores were doing well and which ones needed improvement.
- Found out which customers bring in the most revenue.

## Tools I Used
- **MySQL** – For creating the database and importing the data.
- **Power BI** – For building the dashboards.
- **Excel/CSV** – Original format of the data before I loaded it into SQL.

---

## What I Delivered
- MySQL scripts for creating the tables and importing the data.
- Two interactive dashboards in Power BI.
- A database design showing how the tables are related.

---

## Summary
The project helped me move data from raw CSV files into a proper SQL database, connect it to Power BI, and turn it into dashboards that give clear insights about Products, customers, and stores.
